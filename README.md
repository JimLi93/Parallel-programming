### Lab3 : Edge Detection (CUDA)

Use two 5x5 filter matrix convolved with the original image to calculate approximatations of the derivatives for both horizontal and vertical changes.

### Lab4 : Edge Detection with Optimization (CUDA)

Use two 5x5 filter matrix convolved with the original image to calculate approximatations of the derivatives for both horizontal and vertical changes.

Apply optimizations to improve the preformance.

### Lab5 : DNN Model Calculation (OpenACC)

Apply OpenACC to 3 types of calculations in DNN model.
* Single Layer
* Sigmoid
* Argmax
